<h1>Refund Policy</h1>
<p>Last updated: 2025</p>

<h2>No Refunds</h2>
<p>
All sales on NoveJet are <strong>final</strong>.  
Due to the nature of our product, we do not offer refunds, returns, or exchanges once an order has been placed.  
</p>

<h3>Why We Do Not Offer Refunds</h3>
<ul>
  <li>RC jets and aircraft are flight-based products that can be damaged through handling or usage.</li>
  <li>To ensure safety, hygiene, and performance reliability, items cannot be resold once opened.</li>
  <li>Our fulfillment process begins immediately after the order is placed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Order Cancellations</h3>
<p>
Orders cannot be cancelled once they have been submitted, as processing begins instantly.
</p>

<h3>Damaged or Incorrect Items</h3>
<p>
If your product arrives damaged or you receive the wrong item, please contact us within 48 hours at  
<strong>support@novejet.com</strong> with photo/video proof.  
We will resolve the issue with a replacement shipment when applicable.
</p>

<h3>Chargebacks</h3>
<p>
Initiating false chargebacks is considered fraud.  
We work with Razorpay and card networks to dispute unjustified claims.
